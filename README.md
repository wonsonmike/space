# Overview

I've always wanted to make a video game, so I wanted to learn the basics of using python arcade to build a simple retro style game. This has been a fun project for me, and something that's easy to keep going, as a game is something that's easy to find new things to add. 

This game is a speed test to be able to shoot all the alien robots. You have 15 seconds to shoot all robots, and each round gets harder and harder. There are instructions built into the game. To run the game, you can either run the python app on your own, or there is a Windows executable and a macOS app that can be used to play it.

I wrote this software to have my first try at creating a game in Python through the Python arcade library. I wanted to better understand how to create a game, and what goes into the basics. This is my first time using graphics with sprites, and using the arcade library.

# Development Environment

I used VScode to program this game.

I used the Python programming language, and the arcade and random libraries for this program. The random library gave me random numbers, and the arcade library manages the graphics and sprites, and also provided the visual and audio resources.

# Future Work

* Add background music
* Scoreboard with persistant storage (sqlite)
* Add other retro style games
* Remove up/down motion, lose lives when time runs out?
